Description: In-process task scheduler with Cron-like capabilities
 The Advanced Python Scheduler (APScheduler) is a light but powerful in-process
 task scheduler that lets you schedule jobs (functions or any Python callables)
 to be executed at times of your choosing.
 .
 This can be a far better alternative to externally run cron scripts for
 long-running applications (e.g. web applications), as it is platform neutral
 and can directly access your application's variables and functions.
